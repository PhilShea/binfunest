Description: High performance communications systems typically have inherent noise sources and 
    other perfprmance limitations that need to be estimated.  Measurments made at high signal to 
    noise ratios typicaly result in zero errors due to limitation in available measurement time.  
    The tools of this package help a user make maximum likelihood estimates of the performance 
    parameters that drive a binomial distribution of the observed error, and take full advantage 
    of.  Includes theoretical performance functions for popular modulation methods, and utility 
    functions to work with the methods.
