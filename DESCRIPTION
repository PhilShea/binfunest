Description: High performance communications systems typically have inherent 
    noise sources and other performance limitations that need to be estimated.  
    Measurements made at high signal to noise ratios typically result in zero 
    errors due to limitation in available measurement time. The tools of this 
    package help a user make maximum likelihood estimates of the performance 
    parameters that drive a binomial distribution of the observed error, and 
    take full advantage zero error observations.  Includes theoretical 
    performance functions for common modulation methods, and utility functions 
    to work with the performance functions.
