Description: Provides maximum likelihood estimates of the 
    performance parameters that drive a binomial distribution of observed 
    errors, and takes full advantage zero error observations. 
    High performance communications systems typically have inherent 
    noise sources and other performance limitations that need to be estimated.  
    Measurements made at high signal to noise ratios typically result in zero 
    errors due to limitation in available measurement time.  binfunest Includes 
    theoretical performance functions for common modulation schemes, and utility 
    functions to work with the performance functions.
