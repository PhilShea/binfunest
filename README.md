MLE estimates of function driving binomial distributions.
If you have a series of observations in a vector X, each made at under conditions in a vector Y, and 
the probability of success (or failure) at each observation is P(X, a, b), where a and b are parameters
to be estimated, this pcakage will help call MLE to create a maximun likelihood estimate for the parameters.
